# Airgead Banking App

## Project Summary
The Airgead Banking App is a C++ program that calculates and displays investment growth both with and without additional monthly deposits. It solves the problem of helping users clearly understand how their investments will grow over time, showing yearly balances and interest earned in a professional, formatted report.

## What I Did Well
I did well in designing the program using object-oriented programming principles. The `InvestmentCalculator` class made the code more modular and organized. I also implemented input validation so that the program only accepts positive numerical values, improving the overall reliability of the application.

## Opportunities for Improvement
One area for improvement would be adding more robust error handling and user-friendly messages if invalid data is entered. I could also expand the program to handle different types of investments or interest compounding options. These improvements would make the program more adaptable, efficient, and secure.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The most challenging part of the project was formatting the investment reports to display balances and interest in a clean and readable way. I overcame this by experimenting with `iomanip` in C++ to align numbers and limit decimal places. Online resources and course materials were especially helpful for this challenge.

## Transferable Skills
Through this project, I strengthened several skills that will transfer to future coursework and professional projects:
- Object-oriented programming and class design
- Input validation and error handling
- File organization and project structuring
- Problem decomposition and writing pseudocode
- Clear formatting and presentation of output

## Code Readability and Maintainability
I made the program maintainable and readable by using consistent naming conventions, breaking logic into functions, and documenting the code with comments. The structure of the program allows future updates, such as adding new investment types or extending reporting features, without major rewrites.
